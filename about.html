<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tyrann Snipes, I am 30 years of age and originally from North Carolina. I have sought to do many things
  over the years. I am currently a licensed MST-PSB Therapist. In addition to that, I also specialize in aiding individuals
   with reducing, as well as abstaining from the use of illegal substances. This passion was driven by the inudating 
   experience of being a witness to countless peers being subjected to addiction, subsequently losing thier lives.</p>

<p> I began my professional journey 7 years ago as I underwent studies at a private university while simultaneously working
  under the supervision of a Clinical Counseling Supervisor. This journey was riddled with challenges that I faced head on,
  and ultimately recieved the gift of being able to help others. This ability is a godsend, and I am rewwarded daily when I
  am able to foster positive change in someones life.
</p>

<p>I have continued to be a seeker of knowledge and have decided my next journey to be completely unrelated to my intial one.
  I am currently undergoing intense Software Development training. My goal is to acquire the skills of a fullstack web developer.
  I value the acquisition of this skill because it is one that would allow me more time with loved ones. It would also render me 
  able to continue having an impact on those affected by mental health disorders, antisocial behaviors, and substance use issues.
